AI is now acting as Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and creating Design monitoring systems. Here is the Monitoring and Feedback Plan: Okay, here's the design for the monitoring systems and feedback collection mechanisms for the Resume ATS Scorer project, based on the provided code and deployment plan. This design focuses on providing comprehensive visibility into the application's performance, identifying potential issues, and gathering user feedback to improve the service.

I. Monitoring Systems Design

The monitoring system will be built around three key pillars:

Metrics: Numerical measurements of application performance and resource utilization.
Logs: Detailed records of application events and errors.
Tracing: Tracking the flow of requests through the application to identify bottlenecks.
A. Metrics Collection

Infrastructure Metrics:

Source: Cloud provider monitoring services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, GCP Cloud Monitoring, Azure Monitor) or system-level monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
Metrics:
CPU Utilization: Percentage of CPU used by the application.
Memory Utilization: Percentage of memory used by the application.
Disk I/O: Disk read and write operations per second.
Network Traffic: Bytes sent and received per second.
Disk Space Utilization: Percentage of disk space used.
Collection Frequency: 1 minute.
Application Metrics:

Source: FastAPI application code, using a metrics library (e.g., Prometheus client, Micrometer).
Metrics:
Request Rate: Number of requests received per second for each endpoint.
Request Latency: Time taken to process each request (average, p50, p90, p99 percentiles).
Error Rate: Percentage of requests that result in errors (4xx, 5xx status codes).
File Processing Time: Time taken to parse resumes, extract keywords, and parse job descriptions.
ClamAV Scan Time: Time taken to scan files for viruses (if ClamAV is enabled).
Scoring Time: Time taken to calculate the ATS score.
Queue Length (if using a queue): Number of tasks waiting to be processed.
Custom Metrics:
Number of Resumes Parsed Successfully
Number of Job Descriptions Parsed Successfully
Number of Virus Detections (if ClamAV is enabled)
Collection Frequency: 1 minute.
Logging Metrics:

Source: Application logs.
Metrics:
Error Count: Number of error logs generated per minute.
Warning Count: Number of warning logs generated per minute.
Specific Error Type Counts: Counts of specific error types (e.g., "Failed to parse resume", "Virus detected").
Collection Frequency: 1 minute.
B. Logging Strategy

Logging Level: Use the LOG_LEVEL environment variable to control the logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL). Set the default level to INFO in production.

Log Format: Use a consistent log format that includes:

Timestamp
Log Level
Logger Name
Message
Trace ID (if tracing is enabled)
Example:

2024-01-01 12:00:00 INFO resume_ats_scorer.main Successfully parsed resume: example.pdf

Log Sanitization: Continue using the sanitize_log_message function to remove sensitive information from logs. Regularly review and update the sanitization patterns.

Centralized Logging: Send logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk, CloudWatch Logs, Stackdriver Logging, Azure Monitor Logs). This allows for easier searching, analysis, and alerting.

Structured Logging: Consider using structured logging (e.g., JSON format) to make it easier to parse and analyze logs. Libraries like structlog can help with this.

C. Tracing

Implementation: Use a tracing library (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry) to trace requests as they flow through the application.

Instrumentation: Instrument the FastAPI application code to create spans for key operations, such as:

Receiving a request
Parsing a resume
Extracting keywords
Parsing a job description
Matching resume and job description
Calculating the ATS score
Generating recommendations
Calling external services (e.g., ClamAV)
Context Propagation: Ensure that trace IDs are propagated across different components of the application.

Visualization: Use a tracing UI (e.g., Jaeger UI, Zipkin UI) to visualize traces and identify bottlenecks.

D. Alerting

Alerting Thresholds: Define thresholds for key metrics that trigger alerts. Examples:

CPU Utilization > 80%
Memory Utilization > 90%
Error Rate > 5%
Request Latency (p99) > 1 second
Number of Virus Detections > 0
Specific Error Type Count > 10 per minute (e.g., "Failed to parse resume")
Alerting Channels: Configure alerting channels to notify the SRE team when alerts are triggered. Examples:

Email
Slack
PagerDuty
Alerting Tool: Use an alerting tool (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana Alerts, CloudWatch Alarms, Stackdriver Alerts, Azure Monitor Alerts) to manage alerts.

II. Feedback Collection Mechanisms

Explicit Feedback:

In-App Feedback Form: Include a feedback form in the application UI that allows users to provide feedback on the scoring results, recommendations, and overall experience.
Rating System: Implement a rating system (e.g., star rating) to allow users to rate the accuracy of the scoring results and the helpfulness of the recommendations.
Contact Form: Provide a contact form for users to report bugs, request features, or ask questions.
Implicit Feedback:

Usage Metrics: Track how users are using the application. Examples:
Number of resumes scored
Number of job descriptions parsed
Features used (e.g., specific scoring options)
Time spent on each page
A/B Testing: Conduct A/B tests to compare different versions of the scoring algorithm, recommendations, or UI elements. Track metrics such as conversion rates, engagement, and user satisfaction.
Error Tracking: Monitor error logs and error tracking tools (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to identify common errors and issues.
Feedback Analysis:

Sentiment Analysis: Use sentiment analysis techniques to analyze user feedback and identify positive and negative trends.
Topic Modeling: Use topic modeling techniques to identify common themes and topics in user feedback.
Manual Review: Regularly review user feedback manually to identify actionable insights.
III. Implementation Details

Metrics Library: Choose a metrics library that is compatible with FastAPI and your monitoring infrastructure. Prometheus client is a popular choice.

Example (using Prometheus client):

from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('request_count', 'Total number of requests')
REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram('request_latency_seconds', 'Request latency in seconds')

@app.middleware("http")
async def metrics_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    REQUEST_COUNT.inc()
    start_time = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    REQUEST_LATENCY.observe(process_time)
    return response

Logging Configuration: Configure the Python logging module to send logs to a centralized logging system.

Example (using logging and a file handler):

import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("app.log"),  # Log to a file
        logging.StreamHandler()         # Log to the console
    ]
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Application started")

Tracing Configuration: Configure the tracing library to send traces to a tracing backend.

Example (using OpenTelemetry and Jaeger):

from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.fastapi import FastAPIInstrumentor

# Service name is required for most backends
resource = Resource(attributes={
    SERVICE_NAME: "resume-ats-scorer"
})

tracer_provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
jaeger_exporter = JaegerExporter(
    collector_endpoint="http://localhost:14268/api/traces"  # Replace with your Jaeger endpoint
)
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(jaeger_exporter)
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app(app, tracer_provider=tracer_provider)

Feedback Form Implementation: Use a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) to create a feedback form that submits data to a backend API endpoint.

Data Storage: Store user feedback and usage metrics in a database or data warehouse for analysis.

IV. Key Considerations

Scalability: Design the monitoring system to scale with the application. Use distributed monitoring tools and techniques.
Security: Protect sensitive data in logs and metrics. Use encryption and access control.
Cost: Optimize the monitoring system to minimize costs. Use sampling and aggregation techniques.
Automation: Automate the deployment and configuration of the monitoring system. Use infrastructure-as-code tools.
Maintainability: Design the monitoring system to be easy to maintain and update. Use modular code and clear documentation.
By implementing these monitoring systems and feedback collection mechanisms, you can gain valuable insights into the performance and usability of the Resume ATS Scorer project, allowing you to identify and address issues, improve the service, and provide a better user experience.
