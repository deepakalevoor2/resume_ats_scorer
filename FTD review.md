AI is now acting as Software Architect and reviewing Functional and Technical design doc.Here is the generated Functional and technical design doc review comments: Okay, this is a well-structured and comprehensive design document. It covers the key aspects of the Resume ATS Score Checker project, from functional requirements to technical implementation details. The use of CrewAI and FastAPI is a good choice for building a scalable and maintainable application.

Here are a few suggestions and observations:

User Stories Integration: While you mention the user stories are the foundation, explicitly including the user stories (even in abbreviated form) within the document would improve readability and traceability. Consider adding a table or list referencing each user story and where it's addressed in the design.
Error Handling: The "Resume Parser Agent" acceptance criteria mentions handling parsing errors gracefully. Expand on this in the technical design. How will errors be handled and reported? Will there be retry mechanisms?
Web Scraping Considerations: The document mentions web scraping. Emphasize the importance of handling rate limiting, IP blocking, and changes in website structure. Consider using rotating proxies or APIs where available. Also, be mindful of the terms of service of the websites being scraped.
Matching Algorithm Details: The description of the matching algorithm is a bit high-level. Elaborate on the specific techniques that will be used (e.g., TF-IDF, cosine similarity, word embeddings). Provide more details on how the algorithm will handle synonyms, stemming, and different word forms.
Scoring System Configuration: You mention that the weights for each dimension of the scoring system will be configurable. Describe how this configuration will be implemented (e.g., environment variables, configuration file, database).
Recommendation Engine Logic: Provide more details on the logic behind the recommendation engine. How will it prioritize recommendations? How will it generate explanations for each recommendation?
Database Choice: While the database is optional for the MVP, it's good to consider the long-term implications of not having one. If you anticipate needing to store large amounts of data (resumes, job descriptions, scoring results), it's better to start with a database from the beginning.
API Security: The document doesn't mention API security. Consider adding authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect the API endpoints.
Testing Strategy: Expand on the testing strategy. What types of tests will be implemented (unit, integration, end-to-end)? How will the tests be automated?
PYPI Package Details: Provide more details on the structure and contents of the PYPI package. What files will be included? How will the package be versioned?
Docker Image Optimization: Mention strategies for optimizing the Docker image size (e.g., multi-stage builds, using a minimal base image).
Logging Configuration: Describe how the logging module will be configured (e.g., log level, log format, log file location).
Open Issues: The "Open Issues" section is good. Keep it updated as the project progresses.
Overall, this is a solid design document. Addressing the points above will make it even stronger.

Go ahead, Here is my approval for the design documents
